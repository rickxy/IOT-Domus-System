Domus: Infrastructure
---------------------

The Domus system uses WiFi as a communication medium between devices.
Rather than rely on the user changing their settings or understanding
how to configure WiFi, the system comes with a "bridge" -- essentially
a WiFi access point that is connected to the home router by ethernet
cable.

Domus devices will communicate with each other through the access
point and traffic for outside of the system will be routed to the home
network.

To minimise cost and maximise interoperability, WEP security will be
used for all Domus devices.

Users will soon have access to many features through the web interface
using the username "domus" and password "admin".
